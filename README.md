## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the application using `npm start`.

## Backend Setup

The backend is built using Express and Mongoose. It provides API routes for managing products.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Fetch all products.
- `POST /`: Fetch all products.
- `GET /getSpecificProduct`: Fetch a specific product by ID.
- `POST /getSpecificProduct`: Fetch a specific product by ID.
- `POST /addProduct`: Add a new product.
- `POST /updateSpecificProduct`: Update an existing product.
- `POST /deleteSpecificProduct`: Delete a product.

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the backend server using `node app.js`.

### Using ngrok

To expose your local server to the internet, you can use ngrok.

1. Install ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).
2. Start ngrok with the following command:
   ```
   ngrok http 3010
   ```
3. Replace the API endpoint in your React Native app with the ngrok URL provided.

### Configuration

1. Create the .config file in this path: Yr4-Restaurant-App-Frontend\config.js
2. Add this code:

const config = {
ngrokUrl: "https://<your-ngrok>.ngrok-free.app",
};

export default config;

export const expoPushToken = "ExponentPushToken[yourToken]";
